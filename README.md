# commandlineminesweeper
Part of a series of almost interesting things I codded in notepad just to torture myself. It assumes you are using a default sized command prompt window(80 chars).

A pretty simple minsweeper game I made. Plays in command line and is controlled with the keyboard but besides that it's basically normal mindsweeper. Unflipped tiles look like #, flipped ones will display the number of mines next to them. When you loose the board is revealed in full, M marking mines. * is where you cursor currently is. WASD to move the courser, pressing enter after each move. F flips a tile, G marks it as ?, H marks it as X.
